# SuKaAI

SuKaAI is being rebuilt as an AIGC content creation platform. The former project introduction has been removed while the new product direction is defined.

## Status
- Rebuilding from scratch; documentation and architecture are work in progress
- Core focus: multi-agent assisted ideation, drafting, and publishing workflows
- Tech stack will be confirmed as the new plan stabilizes

## Next Steps
- Define product scope and user journeys
- Finalize initial architecture and data model
- Populate docs with the new SuKaAI specifics
